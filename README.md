# big-data-challenge: Amazon product reviews

This repository contains two scripts performing the ETL process and uploading DataFrames to an RDS instance.

The following [schema](level-1/schema.sql) was used to create the tables in the RDS database. 

The two datasets used to create the DataFrames are linked below:

 1. [Video Games](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz)

 2. [Books](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv.gz)

Each script carries out the following:

 * Creates a SparkSession and connection to Postgres

 * Loads in the datasets from S3 into a DataFrame

 * Drops null and duplicate rows

 * Formats the DataFrame columns to match the schema formats

 * Creates multiple DataFrames for each table in the database

 * Writes the DataFrames to the tables in an RDS instance.
